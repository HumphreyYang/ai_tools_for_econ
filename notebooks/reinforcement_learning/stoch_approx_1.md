# Stochastic Approximation for Fixed Points

If you haven't installed the quantecon Python library yet and you want to run
this lecture, you need to execute the following line first:

```{code-cell} ipython3
!pip install quantecon
```

## Introduction

In this lecture we use stochastic approximation to find fixed points of operators generated by forward looking recursions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import quantecon as qe
from numba import jit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import bisect
```

e study these connections in a separate lecture.

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
