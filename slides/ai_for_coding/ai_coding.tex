    Claude Sonnet:
    
    ``I'm definitely stronger with Python than MATLAB.

    While I'm knowledgeable about both languages, my capabilities with Python
    are more comprehensive. I have deeper familiarity with Python's extensive
    ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and modern development practices. I can
    more confidently help with advanced Python topics, debugging complex Python
    code, and implementing Python best practices.''

    Claude Sonnet:

    ``I'm definitely stronger with Python than Julia.

    Python is one of my most proficient languages - I have deep familiarity with
    its syntax, libraries, frameworks, and best practices across many domains
    including data science, web development, machine learning, and
    general-purpose programming.

    While I understand Julia's syntax and core concepts, my expertise with it
    isn't as comprehensive as with Python.''
